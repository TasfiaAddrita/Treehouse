Tutorials from Treehouse

Hi! You can follow me on my journey through Treehouse, an interactive education platform that offers courses in web, mobile and business development. 

Below I posted several notes that I thought were important to keep in mind.

## Frontend Dev Notes: 
- Best to build mobile website first, then build tablet/desktop.
- HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org
- CSS Validator: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
- CSS Visual Formatting Model: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html

### CSS:
- Margin: adjusts space OUTSIDE of element
- Padding: adjusts space INSIDE of element
- Fluid layout: The page elements have relative width units, like percentages.
- Reponsive design: fluid images, fluid grids, media queries (allow page elements to be adjusted based on width of the page)
